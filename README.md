### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2021

+ Projec title: Exploratory Analysis on the ANES Cumulative Time Series Data - Understanding Our Young Voters
+ This project is conducted by Catherine Gao

+ Project summary: This project uses the Time Series Cumulative Data File from the ANES website and primarily focuses on the political behavior of young voters who are between the age of 17 to 24. In particular, this project explores if there is an increasing rate of young people participating in election voting and what is the profile of those who vote. The ultimate goal is to understand how to attract more young people to vote in elections.
